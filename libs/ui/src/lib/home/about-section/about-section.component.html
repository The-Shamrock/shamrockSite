    <h2>About the Shamrock</h2>
    <p>
      We are The Shamrock - the student run magazine for the Mizzou College of
      Engineering! The Shamrock first formed in 1906, only three years after the
      first E-Week. In our current form, we are a digital magazine hosted right
      here on this website. We seek to inform, entertain, and bring together
      engineers all over Mizzou. So sign up for our email list and follow us on
      social media to say in the loop with what's going on in the College and
      with your fellow students!
